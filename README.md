Try running this with `make && ./node_modules/.bin/coffee src/yaap.litcoffee ARGS...` to see how we might decide to parse some arguments!

**Commit [aefe237](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/yaap/commit/aefe237ea20faac5fcbfafd557cd77aa96d4485b) works, but after reviewing [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) again I can't justify using this over that, so I pushed what I had in commit [fa10601](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/yaap/commit/fa106015974a5323276de6f3dbf44a4100bbf872) and called it a day. Let me know if that diagnosis seems incorrect.**

Yet Another Argument Parser, but this one's better? *(doubtful)*
